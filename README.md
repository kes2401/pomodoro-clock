# Pomodoro Clock
The pomodoro clock is a time management tool using a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length.
These intervals are named pomodoros, and the technique is closely related to concepts such as timeboxing and iterative and incremental
development techniques used in software design. Using the Pomodoro Clock properly also has positive benefits for productivity
as it helps the user focus on the work at hand during short intensive bursts.
